# About *the planned* mass murders on the territory of Ukraine

## Resume

The mass killings of Ukrainian citizens by the Russian invasion are the result of a *pre-planned operation to physically exterminate the socially active stratum of Ukrainian society* .

The "charge" of Russians for such social purges is, in particular, the result of many years of state propaganda in Russia and the invariability of their modus operandi [^ 1] in Ukraine [(see below)](Cleansing.md#%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B6%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B0-%D0%B2-%D1%80%D1%84) .

## Confirmation

### Uniformity of executions

The similarity and uniformity of executions of different people in different settlements indicates their implementation according to a single methodology.

Thus, among the mass killings of civilians in the Kyiv region, the killings of people clearly stand out:

- mostly men of military age,
- with his hands tied behind his back and a bullet hole in the back of his head.

Considering:

- the relative humanity of the method of execution (the brain is destroyed before a person has time to feel pain),
- the fact that the method of execution [was widely used by the NKVD](https://twitter.com/Churchill_N1/status/606656825774194690) ,
- the method of execution is still [used in Belarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Belarus#Method)

there is every reason to believe that the relevant literature of the Soviet era can exist in closed archives and be used by officers of the Russian security forces.

### Mass burials

In Russia, the new GOST R 42.7.01-2021 on mass burials was adopted in September 2021 and put into effect on February 1, 2022, a little more than 3 weeks before the start of the open war: [National Standard of the Russian Federation. Urgent burial of corpses in wartime and peacetime](https://docs.cntd.ru/document/1200180859) ( [Web Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20220402173717/https://docs.cntd.ru/document/1200180859) ).

According to the standard of the Russian Federation the pit for mass burial should have the following sizes:

- 20m - length at the bottom,
- 3m - width,
- 2.3m - depth,
- 32m - at the top, taking into account the slopes for the departure of the tractor.

#### Mass burial in Bucha

Coordinates: [50.548338967408654, 30.205741390181334](https://www.google.com/maps/place/50%C2%B032'54.0%22N+30%C2%B012'20.7%22E/@50.5484609,30.2058379,115m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x15cf9fe2434bd718!8m2!3d50.548339!4d30.2057414)

Length - 13.15 m, variable width - from 3.2 m to 2.4 m. The initial depth can be established only after the exhumation, now the pit is filled with bodies.

#### Mass burial in Andriyivka

Coordinates: [50.5502094, 29.8330253](https://www.google.com/maps/place/50%C2%B033'00.8%22N+29%C2%B049'58.9%22E/@50.5502835,29.8329207,115m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x8cd1f9f20a211e34!8m2!3d50.5502094!4d29.8330253)

Length - 10.5 meters, width - 4 m, depth - 4 m. There are no bodies in the pit. The owner of the yard received information from the soldiers who dug the pit that the pit was intended for the corpses of the villagers.

37 people disappeared in the village during the occupation. As of March 8, 2022, the burial places of 9 killed were found or known. Three of them were killed in a characteristic way: hands tied behind his back and a bullet in the back of the head.

### Lists

The Russians compiled lists of Ukrainians for destruction and isolation.

A few days before the invasion, a US representative to the UN Geneva Office wrote [a letter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/read-u-s-letter-to-the-u-n-alleging-russia-is-planning-human-rights-abuses-in-ukraine/93a8d6a1-5b44-4ae8-89e5-cd5d328dd150/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4) to the OHCHR (UN Headquarters for Human Rights) expressing concern about the information.

[⚠️ Objective: to obtain from the American side additional information about the lists and the criteria for their compilation](https://github.com/zbroyar/mass_killings/issues/17)

### Mobile crematoria

Mobile crematoria were intended to avoid the burials of Ukrainian public figures, as publicly known burial sites eventually became "pilgrimage sites" (modus operandi similar to the murder of Roman Shukhevych, [see below](Cleansing.md#%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B6%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B0-%D0%B2-%D1%80%D1%84) ).

The preparation of mobile crematoria for the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian army the day before the invasion was announced by the Minister of Defense of the United Kingdom Ben Wallace. This was written, in particular, by [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/02/23/russia-deploys-mobile-crematorium-follow-troops-battle) ( [Web Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20220331033347/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/02/23/russia-deploys-mobile-crematorium-follow-troops-battle) ). However, Mr. Walles erroneously decided that with their help the Russian army was going to hide its own losses.

The following facts can serve as confirmation of the thesis that crematoria were not intended for Russian soldiers:

- where the Russian army generally collected its corpses, their export outside Ukraine was arranged;
- the use of mobile crematoria for mass cremation is irrational due to [the characteristics stated by the manufacturer](http://turmalin.su/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=185&Itemid=331) ( [Web Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20220226133306/http://turmalin.su/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=185&Itemid=331) ):

> When used for ritual purposes:
>
> - time of full cremation of one object: about 1 hour
> - ash unloading is automated
> - cremation
> - additional dust cleaning system
> - 15-16 liters of diesel fuel or 20 m3 of natural gas for cremation of one object

### 45,000 bags for corpses

The bags were intended for citizens of Ukraine.

If the bags were intended for the corpses of Russian servicemen, it would mean that the Russians, having gathered 200,000 soldiers for the invasion, planned irreparable losses of 22.5% and total losses (including the wounded) of 90% of the total number of the group, which is unrealistic. [^ 2].

That is, if bags for corpses are intended for Russian soldiers, the expected percentage of killed: `45000/200000 x 100% = 22.5%` . Statistics show that the wounded are usually three times more than the killed, ie the number of wounded: `3 х 22.5% = 67.5%` . Thus, the total losses (killed and wounded): `22.5% + 67.5% = 90%` .

Common sense suggests that starting a war of aggression and counting on losses at the level of 90% of the personnel is simply meaningless.

### State propaganda in Russia

The following public materials call for the forced division / redistribution of the territory of Ukraine, as well as for the killings of Ukrainian citizens.

### Historical data on the modus operandi of Russians in Ukraine

The events of the last 8 years demonstrate the invariability of the modus operandi of Russians in Ukraine over the last century:

    > "The crime committed by the Bolsheviks in Kyiv - the execution of defenseless victims not for what they committed, but for who they were - corresponds to what is called in the literature a genocidal strategy: the intention to destroy a specific group of people. In our case, there were two such groups: representatives of the "old order" - the aristocracy, officials, generals, officers - and supporters of the UPR - politicians and soldiers. In a more detailed analysis of these metrics, there may be grounds to single out the third group - young men. "

### Opinion of British intelligence

The head of British military intelligence MI6 wrote that they had information about the planned extrajudicial killings before the invasion:

> We knew Putin's invasion plans included summary executions by his military and intelligence services. The reports of execution-style killings of civilians emerging from liberated areas are horrifying and chilling.

[https://twitter.com/ChiefMI6/status/1510629183365517326](https://twitter.com/ChiefMI6/status/1510629183365517326)

[^ 1]: Modus operandi - a phrase from Latin, roughly meaning "method of action". In the plural modi operandi ("methods of action"). This phrase is used in jurisprudence to describe the manner in which a crime was committed. In the criminal sense, modus operandi can be used to determine the profile of the offender, where the keys to the psychology of the offender can be found.

[^ 2]: Usually, when planning military operations, the percentage of permissible irreparable losses (in other words, killed) is set, based on which the needs for evacuation transport, medicines, places in hospitals and packages for corpses are further calculated. Irreversible losses are very rarely planned at more than 5%, as it is statistically known that the wounded are usually three times more than killed. In other words, if you plan, for example, 10% of the dead, then they will need to add another 30% of the wounded, which will give a total of 40% of fighters who will lose combat capability during the operation.
